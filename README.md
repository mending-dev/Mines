# Mines

A lightweight and powerful plugin for Paper servers (version 1.21+), designed to make mine creation and management fast, easy, and flexible. With **Mines**, server administrators can create, edit, and manage multiple mines, control reset intervals, set custom block contents, and more—all without unnecessary overhead.

Mines is perfect for **SkyMines**, **BoxPvP**, **Prison servers**, or any server where automated, resettable mines are needed.

The plugin provides the main `/mines` command with several subcommands:

- `/mines wand` – Get a wand to set positions for new mines.
- `/mines save <name>` – Save current selection.
- `/mines reset <name>` – Reset a specific mine.
- `/mines set interval <name> <seconds>` – Set the reset interval for a specific mine.
- `/mines set location <name>` – Set the teleport location for a mine.
- `/mines reload` – Reload all mine configurations.
